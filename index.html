            <article>
                <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) allows you to create great-looking web pages, but how does it work under
                    the hood? This article explains what CSS is, with a simple syntax example, and also covers some key
                    terms about the language.</p>
                <p>In the Introduction to HTML module we covered what HTML is, and how it is used to mark up documents.
                    These documents will be readable in a web browser. Headings will look larger than regular text,
                    paragraphs break onto a new line and have space between them. Links are colored and underlined to
                    distinguish them from the rest of the text. What you are seeing is the browser's default styles —
                    very basic styles that the browser applies to HTML to make sure it will be basically readable even
                    if no explicit styling is specified by the author of the page.</p>
                <p>However, the web would be a boring place if all websites looked like that. Using CSS you can control
                    exactly how HTML elements look in the browser, presenting your markup using whatever design you
                    like.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="How_CSS_works">
            <header>How CSS works</header>
            <article>
                <p>When a browser displays a document, it must combine the document's content with its style
                    information. It
                    processes the document in a number of stages, which we've listed below. Bear in mind that this is a
                    very
                    simplified version of what happens when a browser loads a webpage, and that different browsers will
                    handle the process in different ways. But this is roughly what happens.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The browser loads the HTML (e.g. receives it from the network).</li>
                    <li>It converts the HTML into a DOM (Document Object Model). The DOM represents the document in the
                        computer's memory. The DOM is explained in a bit more detail in the next section.</li>
                    <li>The browser then fetches most of the resources that are linked to by the HTML document, such as
                        embedded images and videos ... and linked CSS! JavaScript is handled a bit later on in the
                        process, and we won't talk about it here to keep things simpler.</li>
                    <li>The browser parses the fetched CSS, and sorts the different rules by their selector types into
                        different "buckets", e.g. element, class, ID, and so on. Based on the selectors it finds, it
                        works out which rules should be applied to which nodes in the DOM, and attaches style to them as
                        required (this intermediate step is called a render tree).</li>
                    <li>The render tree is laid out in the structure it should appear in after the rules have been
                        applied to it.</li>
                    <li>The visual display of the page is shown on the screen (this stage is called painting).</li>
                </ol>
            </article>

        <section class="main-section" id="CSS_syntax">
            <header>CSS syntax</header>
            <article>
                <p>CSS is a rule-based language — you define rules specifying groups of styles that should be applied to
                    particular elements or groups of elements on your web page. For example "I want the main heading on
                    my page to be shown as large red text."</p>

                <p>The following code shows a very simple CSS rule that would achieve the styling described above:</p>
                <code><div class="purple">h1</div> {
                    <div class="red">color</div>: red;
                    <div class="red">font-size</div>: 5em;
            }</code>

                <p style="display: inline;">The rule opens with a selector . This selects the HTML element that we are
                    going to style. In this
                    case we are styling level one headings (<xmp><h1></xmp>).</p>
                <p>We then have a set of curly braces <code>{ }</code>. Inside those will be one or more declarations,
                    which take the
                    form of property and value pairs. Each pair specifies a property of the element(s) we are selecting,
                    then a value that we'd like to give the property.</p>
                <p>
                    Before the colon, we have the property, and after the colon, the value. CSS properties have
                    different allowable values, depending on which property is being specified. In our example, we have
                    the <code>color</code> property, which can take various color values. We also have the
                    <code>font-size</code> property. This
                    property can take various size units as a value.
                </p>

                <p>A CSS stylesheet will contain many such rules, written one after the other.</p>
                <code><div class="purple">h1</div> {
                    <div class="red">color</div>: red;
                    <div class="red">font-size</div>: 5em;
        }
        
        <div class="purple">p</div> {
            <div class="red">color</div>: black;
        }</code>

                <p>
                    You will find that you quickly learn some values, whereas others you will need to look up. The
                    individual property pages on MDN give you a quick way to look up properties and their values when
                    you forget, or want to know what else you can use as a value.

        <section class="main-section" id="Adding_CSS_to_our_document">
            <header>Adding CSS to our document</header>
            <article>
                <p>The very first thing we need to do is to tell the HTML document that we have some CSS rules we want
                    it to use. There are three different ways to apply CSS to an HTML document that you'll commonly come
                    across, however, for now, we will look at the most usual and useful way of doing so — linking CSS
                    from the head of your document.</p>
                <p>Create a file in the same folder as your HTML document and save it as <code>styles.css</code>. The
                    <code>.css</code> extension
                    shows that this is a CSS file.</p>
                <p style="display: inline;">To link <code>styles.css</code> to <code>index.html</code>, add the
                    following line somewhere inside the <xmp><head></xmp> of the HTML
                    document:
                </p>
                <code><<div class="green">link </div> <div class="red">rel</div>="<div class="green">stylesheet</div>" <div class="red">href</div>="<div class="green">styles.css</div>"></code>
                <p style="display: inline;">This <xmp><link></xmp> element tells the browser that we have a stylesheet, using the <xmp>rel</xmp> attribute,
                    and the
                    location of that stylesheet as the value of the <xmp>href</xmp> attribute. You can test that the
                    CSS works by
                    adding a rule to <xmp>styles.css</xmp>. Using your code editor, add the following to your CSS
                    file:
                </p>
                <code><div class="purple">h1</div> {
                    <div class="red">color</div>: red;
                  }</code>
                <p>
                    Save your HTML and CSS files and reload the page in a web browser. The level one heading at the top
                    of the document should now be red. If that happens, congratulations — you have successfully applied
                    some CSS to an HTML document. If that doesn't happen, carefully check that you've typed everything
                    correctly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can continue to work in <code>styles.css</code> locally, or you can use our interactive editor
                    below to
                    continue with this tutorial. The interactive editor acts as if the CSS in the first panel is linked
                    to the HTML document, just as we have with our document above.

            <header>Styling HTML elements</header>
            <article>
                <p>By making our heading red, we have already demonstrated that we can target and style an HTML element.
                    We do this by targeting an element selector — this is a selector that directly matches an HTML
                    element name. To target all paragraphs in the document, you would use the selector <code>p</code>.
                    To turn all
                    paragraphs green, you would use:</p>
                <code>
                        <div class="purple">p</div> {
                            <div class="red">color</div>: green;
                          }
                    </code>
                <p>
                    You can target multiple selectors at the same time by separating the selectors with a comma. If you
                    want all paragraphs and all list items to be green, your rule would look like this:
                </p>
                <code>
                    <div class="purple">p, li</div> {
                       <div class="red">color</div>: green;
                    }
                </code>
            </article>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="Adding_a_class">
            <header>Adding a class</header>
            <article>
                <p>So far, we have styled elements based on their HTML element names. This works as long as you want all
                    of the elements of that type in your document to look the same. Most of the time that isn't the case
                    and so you will need to find a way to select a subset of the elements without changing the others.
                    The most common way to do this is to add a class to your HTML element and target that class.</p>
                <p>In your HTML document, add a class attribute to the second list item. Your list will now look like
                    this:</p>

                <code><xmp>
<ul>
    <li>Item one</li>
    <li class="special">Item two</li>
    <li>Item <em>three</em></li>
</ul>
                    </xmp></code>
                <p>In your CSS, you can target the class of <code>special</code> by creating a selector that starts with
                    a full stop
                    character.</p>
                <code>
                        <div class="purple">.special</div> {
                           <div class="red">color</div>: orange;
                           <div class="red">font-weight</div>: bold;
                          }
                    </code>

                <p style="display: inline;">You can apply the class of special to any element on your page that you want
                    to have the same look as
                    this list item. For example, you might want the <xmp><span></xmp> in the paragraph to also be orange
                    and bold.</p>
                <p>Sometimes you will see rules with a selector that lists the HTML element selector along with the
                    class:</p>
                <code>
                        <class class="purple">li.special</class> {
                          <class class="red">color</class>: orange;
                           <class class="red"> font-weight</class>: bold;
                          }
                    </code>
                <p style="display: inline;">This syntax means "target any <code>li</code> element that has a class of
                    special". If
                    you were to do this, then you would no longer be able to apply the class to a <xmp><span></xmp> or
                    another
                    element by adding the class to it; you would have to add that element to the list of selectors:
                </p>
                <code>
                   <div class="purple">li.special,
span.special</div>  {
 <div class="red">color</div>: orange;
 <div class="red">font-weight</div> : bold;
}
                </code>
                <p>
                    As you can imagine, some classes might be applied to many elements and you don't want to have to
                    keep editing your CSS every time something new needs to take on that style. Therefore, it is
                    sometimes best to bypass the element and refer to the class, unless you know that you want to create
                    some special rules for one element alone, and perhaps want to make sure they are not applied to
                    other things.
